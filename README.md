# Horizontal Screen Ruler

A lightweight Python utility built with **PyQt5** that overlays a persistent horizontal line on your screen. Designed for Ubuntu, it serves as a visual guide or reading ruler that stays on top of all other windows.

## Key Features
*   **Always on Top:** Stays visible regardless of which application is in focus.
*   **Mouse-Adjustable:** Click and drag the line to reposition it; grab the right edge to resize the width.
*   **Minimalist UI:** Frameless window with a transparent background for a clean look.
*   **Quick Exit:** Close the overlay instantly by pressing the `Esc` key.

## Quick Start
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
